we calculate the mean and variance of sales data for 2021 and 2022,
to compare the variability or spread of the sales data between the two years.

The mean is the average value of a set of numbers,
and it provides information about the tendency of the data.

In this case, 
calculating the mean of sales data for each year 
and compare the average sales performance between the two years.

The variance, 
measures how much the sales data deviates from the mean. 
A higher variance indicates that the sales data is more spread out or variable,
while a lower variance indicates that the data is more tightly clustered around the mean. 
By calculating the variance for each year's sales data,
we can compare the spread of sales performance between the two years 
and assess whether there has been a significant change in the variability of sales.
